# Introduction

## Purpose

This System Architecture Document (SAD) describes how the Peat Rewetting Planning system is built, deployed and operated. It explains the main structures, the reasons behind them and the measured quality of the result.

## Scope

The system covers:

- A PostgreSQL 17 and PostGIS 3.5 database with seven data domains and full change history.
- Repeatable data pipelines that load four source datasets (about 3.8 million features).
- A standards-based web service (OGC API) built on pygeoapi, behind a Caddy reverse proxy.
- Deployment automation for Hetzner Cloud.

The web user interface shown in the design mockup is **not** part of this delivery. The database and API are designed so that the interface can be built on top of them.

## Audience

Architects, developers, GIS engineers, operators and the team presenting the system.

# Architectural goals and constraints

## Goals

| Goal | What it means in practice |
|---|---|
| **Standards first** | Any GIS tool must read the data without custom code: OGC API Features, Tiles and Processes. |
| **Two editing channels** | Analysts edit directly in QGIS (PostGIS connection) and through web or API clients, at the same time. |
| **Full traceability** | Every change is recorded with user, tool, time, old and new values, and plan version. |
| **Low running cost** | A demo costs about EUR 0.05 per hour; production should stay near EUR 1 per day. |
| **Reproducible** | The whole database can be rebuilt from source files with one command. |
| **Open source only** | PostgreSQL, PostGIS, pygeoapi, Caddy, GDAL, Python. No licence fees. |

## Constraints

- Source data arrives as shapefiles and an Esri File Geodatabase with inconsistent names, mixed units and duplicates.
- The largest layers hold close to one million polygons each, so queries must use spatial indexes.
- QGIS writes straight to the database, so auditing cannot live in application code.
- The team has no dedicated operations staff, so deployment must be scripted end to end.

<p class="figure-note">Figure 3. Database schemas and how triggers connect them.</p>

Three triggers run on every editable layer, in this order:

1. **`a_meta` (before)**: fills `khg_id` from the geometry, sets created and updated user, time and channel, and increments `rev`.
2. **`b_kode` (before insert)**: assigns the next code (`P-n`, `SK-n`, `K-n`) inside the KHG.
3. **`z_audit` (after)**: writes a change record with old and new values and links it to the open plan version. It runs as SECURITY DEFINER, so editors cannot write change records themselves.

The writer's identity comes from session settings. The web application sets `app.pengguna` and `app.via` per transaction. QGIS users log in with their own database role, and the API writer role has `app.via = 'api'` as a default.

# Data architecture and pipeline

## Sources

| Source | Format | Features | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Canal blocks BRGM PPEG | 5 shapefiles | 348,143 | 28,685 exact duplicates removed; one wrong contour field fixed |
| BlueBook PEG 2026 | File Geodatabase, 7 layers | 2,671,331 | Analysis units, target villages, canals, contours, hydrological infrastructure |
| Burned areas 2015 to 2026 | Shapefile | 584,723 | Year columns converted to an array |
| Hotspots January to September 2026 | 9 shapefiles in 2 formats | 167,718 | FIRMS and SiPongi KML exports unified |

<p class="figure-note">Figure 4. Build pipeline run by db/setup.sh.</p>

Key design points:

- **Staging first.** Raw data lands in an unlogged `staging` schema, then SQL moves it into the model. Loads run with triggers disabled so that 3.8 million imported rows do not flood the audit log.
- **Coverage union.** KHG boundaries, concessions and peat thickness are dissolved from analysis units with `ST_CoverageUnion`, falling back to `ST_Union` when a result is invalid. All 866 KHG boundaries are valid; their total area differs from the source attribute by 0.3 percent.
- **Subdivided lookups.** KHG polygons are split with `ST_Subdivide` before point-in-polygon joins, which makes KHG assignment for 1.5 million features fast.
- **Spatial linking.** The canal-block source has no canal id (its `Id` column is the contour id), so each block is linked to the nearest canal. 99.85 percent of links match the canal length stated in the source.

<p class="figure-note">Figure 5. Production style deployment.</p>

| Environment | Machine | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Local development | Apple Silicon laptop, Docker Desktop | PostGIS image runs as amd64 through Rosetta; build takes 9.4 minutes |
| Demo (active) | Hetzner cpx22, Singapore: 2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM, 80 GB disk | EUR 0.0497 per hour, no backups, `https://5-223-68-87.sslip.io` |
| Recommended production | Hetzner cpx32, Singapore: 4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM, 160 GB disk | Daily Hetzner backups plus a nightly `pg_dump` kept for 7 days |

Deployment is fully scripted:

1. `deploy/provision.sh` creates the SSH key, firewall and server through the Hetzner API. It refuses server types that can no longer be ordered and asks for confirmation before any cost is incurred.
2. `deploy/deploy.sh` waits for cloud-init, syncs files, generates new passwords on the server, uploads and restores the dump (resumable), creates roles, starts the services, obtains TLS certificates and runs smoke tests. It is idempotent and adapts PostgreSQL memory settings to the server size.

# Cross-cutting concerns

## Security

| Layer | Control |
|---|---|
| Network | Hetzner firewall and ufw allow only ports 22, 80 and 443. The database listens on 127.0.0.1 only. |
| Transport | HTTPS with automatic Let's Encrypt certificates. Editors reach the database through SSH tunnels. |
| Authentication | HTTP Basic authentication (bcrypt hash) for writes. SSH keys only; password login and root login are disabled. |
| Authorisation | Database roles: `gambut_baca` (read), `gambut_edit` (write planning layers), `ogc_reader`, `ogc_writer`, `web_app`, one role per QGIS editor. |
| Integrity | Audit and versioning functions run as SECURITY DEFINER; editors cannot forge change records. |
| Secrets | Passwords are random per environment, stored in `.env` files with mode 600 and excluded from Git. |
| Abuse limits | 5,000 features per request, 30 second statement timeout and connection limits for API roles. |

## Performance (measured)

| Operation | Local laptop | Demo server (Singapore) |
|---|---|---|
| KHG list with sort and filter | 0.15 to 0.35 s | 0.49 s server time |
| Canal blocks in a bounding box | 0.06 s | within 1 s end to end |
| Vector tile (canals, zoom 12) | 0.3 s, 24 KB | about 1.3 s including 212 ms network round trip |
| Full test suite (`db/tests.sql`) | 9 s | passed |
| Full rebuild from source | 9.4 min | not needed (restore from dump) |
| Restore from dump | 2 min 48 s | part of a 25 minute deployment |

Two optimisations mattered most: spatial prefilters (`&&` with `ST_Expand`) before geodesic distance checks, and planar distance near the equator for very large polygons. Together they cut the validation test from 4 minutes to 9 seconds.

## Availability and recovery

| Item | Demo | Production target |
|---|---|---|
| Topology | Single VM | Single VM |
| Backups | None | Hetzner daily snapshot + nightly `pg_dump` (7 days) + optional offsite copy |
| Recovery time | About 25 minutes (reprovision and restore) | About 1 hour |
| Maximum data loss | Everything since the last dump | 24 hours, or minutes with WAL archiving |

## Observability

Caddy access logs, container logs (`docker compose logs`) and a smoke test after every deployment. An uptime check on the landing page and one collection is recommended for production.

# Architecture decisions

| No | Decision | Alternatives considered | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| AD1 | PostGIS as the single source of truth | GeoPackage files, cloud feature services | Concurrent editing, SQL power, QGIS support |
| AD2 | Audit and versioning in database triggers | Application-level logging | QGIS writes directly to the database |
| AD3 | Lookup tables instead of ENUM types | PostgreSQL ENUM | QGIS value relation widgets and easy extension |
| AD4 | pygeoapi for OGC API | GeoServer, pg_featureserv | OGC reference implementation, supports Features Part 4, Tiles and Processes in one service, small footprint |
| AD5 | Separate `api` schema of views | Publish tables directly | Stable public contract with readable names |
| AD6 | Keep national and target analysis units | Keep target units only | Chosen by the product owner; enables national analysis |
| AD7 | Caddy for TLS and auth | nginx with certbot | Automatic certificates and simple configuration |
| AD8 | Hetzner Singapore | GCP Jakarta, DigitalOcean, Contabo | Best cost to reliability ratio with low latency; GCP is 2.5 to 4.5 times more expensive |

# Risks and technical debt

| Risk or debt | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Single server | Downtime during failure | Scripted redeploy in about 25 minutes |
| Shared API writer account | Change records cannot tell API users apart | Use the web application with per-user identity, or per-editor database roles |
| pygeoapi PUT requires full geometry and PATCH is not supported | Clients must send complete features | Documented; web client can wrap it |
| Provisional scoring weights | Priorities may not match policy | Confirm with domain experts |
| Missing data (rivers, canal status, pumps, loggers, wells, KHG codes) | Some screens show empty values | Structures exist; load when data arrives |
| Mixed hotspot sources per month | Misleading monthly trends | Re-download all months from one source |
| Data residency | Government data may need to stay in Indonesia (PP 71/2019) | Same stack can move to GCP Jakarta or a local provider |

# Cost summary

| Option | Per day | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Hetzner cpx22 Singapore, no backup | about EUR 1.19 | Current demo |
| Hetzner cpx32 Singapore with backup | about EUR 2.7 | Recommended production |
| GCP Compute Engine Jakarta, self-managed | about USD 3.2 | If data must stay in Indonesia |
| GCP Cloud SQL plus small VM, Jakarta | about USD 5.5 | Managed database |

Prices are Hetzner API list prices including tax in September 2026 and published GCP rates; confirm before budgeting.
